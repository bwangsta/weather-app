# Weather App
This project was completed for The Odin Project Javascript Weather App Project. The purpose of this project was to create a weather application that can receive data from the Openweather API. I decided to switch to Open Meteo API due to lack of data in the free version for the Openweather API.

## Built With 
- Javascript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Webpack
